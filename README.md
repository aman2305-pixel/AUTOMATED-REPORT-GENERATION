In this task, I developed a Python script that reads data from a file, performs analysis, and generates a PDF report using libraries like FPDF or ReportLab. I chose to use CSV data for the report generation. The script read the file using pandas, performed basic statistical analysis, and generated summaries like mean, median, and distribution. Then, using ReportLab, I created a professionally formatted PDF containing the analysis results, titles, and custom styling. This task helped me gain hands-on experience in automating documentation and presenting data effectively. All development was performed in VS Code, where I took advantage of the integrated terminal and auto-completion features to speed up my workflow.
